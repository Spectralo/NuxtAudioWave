# Nuxt Audio Wave

A simple Nuxt App written in 2 hours
It display the sound your microphone hear in a (maybe?) beautiful way. 
It's not perfect because it uses the sound of your microphone, which is probably not next to your speakers.

## How to run it on your own server!

Idk what you would do that but here you go 

*If you use Node, then replace each bun by node*

```
bun install
bun run build
bun .output/server/index.mjs
```
